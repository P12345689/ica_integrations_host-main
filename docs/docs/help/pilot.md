# Assistants Extension & Integrations SDK "Closed Beta"

We are excited to invite you to participate in the closed beta testing of the Assistants Extension & Integrations SDK v0.7.0, released on 2024-04-29. As a valued developer with experience in Python, we believe your input will be invaluable in shaping the future of this SDK.

## About the SDK

The Assistants Extension & Integrations SDK is designed to help build IBM Consulting Assistants Extensions and Integrations. It consists of a range of tools and libraries, including libica, icacli, langchain_consultingassistants, ansible_consultingassistants, ica.sh, and icamock, which provide a comprehensive way to interact with IBM Consulting Assistants' Extension APIs.

## Requirements
To participate in the closed beta, you must:

1. Have an **existing IBM Consulting Assistants Extension ID**.
2. Have Python experience and be building applications in Python (or Ansible/CLI) with or without Langchain.
3. Be willing to provide detailed feedback and accept that the SDK configuration and methods may change during the beta period.

**Note** by agreeing to sign up to this pilot, you confirm that you are able to provide detailed feedback on any encountered issues, and help test their resolution.

## Providing Feedback

We encourage you to provide feedback on a weekly basis during the duration of the pilot, from 2024-04-29 to the release day of v1.0 on 2024-05-20. Please send your feedback to Mihai Criveti and Chris Hay.

## What to Expect

The current release is a significant step towards the upcoming v1.0 release on 2024-05-20, which will include a fully feature-complete SDK.

Your input will help us refine the SDK and ensure it meets the needs of developers like you.
