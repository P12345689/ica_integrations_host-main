Generate a .pages file for MkDocs navigation using the following directories:
{% for dir in directories %}
- {{ dir }}
{% endfor %}

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Use appropriate emojis that represent the content or purpose of each directory.
2. Structure the navigation logically, grouping related items if necessary.
3. Use clear and concise labels for each navigation item.
4. If applicable, create sub-sections for better organization.
5. Ensure the structure is easy to read and navigate.

Provide the .pages content in YAML format below:

nav:
  - "ðŸ”Œ Overview": index.md
  - "Public (Production)":
    - "ðŸ“„ Document Builder": docbuilder.md
    - "ðŸ”¢ Synthetic Data Generator": datagenerator.md


Only provided the content starting from nav, don't quite it, don't add any other explanations, just valid yaml as output.
