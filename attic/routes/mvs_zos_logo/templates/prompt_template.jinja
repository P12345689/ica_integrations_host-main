Create a simple ASCII art logo for an MVS or z/OS system based on the theme: "{{ theme }}".
The logo should be no more than 6 lines tall and 40 characters wide.
Use only ASCII characters that are likely to be supported on older mainframe systems.
Do not include any explanatory text, just output the ASCII art logo.
