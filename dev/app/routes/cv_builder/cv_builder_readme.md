# CV Assistant Integration

## Overview
Workforce Management teams face challenges connecting the right professionals with clients due to limited visibility into the professionals' skills, experience, and qualifications. This is largely attributed to the inefficiencies in creating and maintaining up-to-date and complete CVs.

Professionals struggle to efficiently and effectively showcase their skills and experiences, often due to:
- A time-consuming and labor-intensive process of creating and updating their CVs
- Difficulty in highlighting relevant skills and experiences, leading to missed opportunities
- Limited understanding of what makes a CV effective in attracting potential clients
- Inadequate formatting and styling, making it difficult to present their qualifications in a clear and concise manner

As a result, Workforce Management is unable to efficiently match professionals with the right assignments, leading to suboptimal client satisfaction and reduced business performance. Currently, there are approximately 120,000 professionals with outdated CVs, and only 30% update their CVs regularly.

Geography teams are wasting valuable time and resources on manual efforts to gather updated CVs from professionals, resulting in inefficient use of resources and potential delays in assigning projects. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and inconsistencies, ultimately hindering the team's ability to effectively match professionals with the right projects and assignments.
